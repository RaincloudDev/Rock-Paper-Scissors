Aug 5, 2020-- GAME IS CURRENTLY BROKEN. issue submitted to fix the evylenChoice output and scoring error.

AUG 6, 2020 --fixed an issue that caused Evylen to output incorrect choices. types were being confused along the way. Currently adding feedback in the UI for both player's choices. This will be lighlty animated in some way to show choices as well as win or lose. code is still very messy, attempting to update as much as possible while school is starting, still trying to nail some sort of schedule down. 

--open console to see the current state of logic. currently the player's choices are logged as numbers. 

0-rock
1-paper
2-scissors

--((1<>2) displayed in the console indicates the player chose paper and Evylen chose scissors.)

--Choices are logged before and after comparison to help identify any issues. this was implemented before the issues arose but helped a lot to fix things.

-there are messages in the console based on winner/loser of each round with a tie message ("BOWTIE MACCARONI")
--points are calculated and the player receives a message that alerts them to their winning or losing state "you are winning/losing" each turn.
-rounds are not yet implemented. 

FEEL FREE TO ENJOY THE GAME, BUT KNOW IT IS IN NO FINISHED STATE. 
thanks!! -RaincloudDev
